voice controlled infrared remote arduino
This code is designed for Arduino Due board, may need further modification to be compatible with other board

The Arduino board must work with external voice-match module, this code enables Arduino board to be able to read the original infrared signal, stores the infrared signal, and match with the voice that the voice-matching module recognizes.

This code also provides a nice interactive user-interface with the LED screen and buttons.
